## 🌍 Inspiration

Across rural and underserved regions, communities face overlapping vulnerabilities—from human–animal conflict and health emergencies to agricultural instability and climate shocks. These challenges directly impact SDGs like:

- 🥗 SDG 2: Zero Hunger  
- 🏥 SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being  
- 🌱 SDG 13: Climate Action  
- 🐘 SDG 15: Life on Land  

We built Smart Resilience Hub to empower local governments, NGOs, and youth-led networks with real-time, privacy-conscious intelligence for faster, smarter decisions.

## 🚀 What It Does

Smart Resilience Hub is a cloud-native platform that:

- Ingests real-time data from IoT sensors, mobile apps, and community reports  
- Uses a custom-built Fivetran connector to automate data movement into BigQuery  
- Applies Vertex AI models to analyze patterns and generate actionable insights  
- Delivers predictive alerts and agentic workflows via a real-time dashboard

### Key Features

- 🐾 Predictive alerts for human–animal conflict (SDG 15)  
- 🏥 Health risk detection and intervention suggestions (SDG 3)  
- 🌾 Agricultural resilience recommendations (SDG 2)  
- 🧭 Agentic workflows for NGOs and local officials (SDG 11, SDG 13)
